This is corporate website API for small business. This api have

 - Authorization Controller
 - User Controller
 - Service Controller

I use <code>BUN</code> package management, <code>PRISMA</code> ORM system and <code>POSTGRESQL</code> for database.

If you want to use this API, you can pull and first step is <code>bun install</code> then, <code>bun prisma generate</code>

After that, you can change your database login credentials in <code>.env</code> file and then <code>bun prisma db push</code>

After all that you can start your API project with <code> bun run start </code> command.

Have Fun!
